# Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

eggs = 1
print(eggs)
#100 = 2
#print(100)

# Because variable name:
# * can be only one word
# * can use only letters, numbers, and underscore (_) charachter
# * can't begin with a number 

# 100 is a number so you can't use it a variable name,
# therefore:    print(eggs) output is 1
#               print(100) output gives an error
