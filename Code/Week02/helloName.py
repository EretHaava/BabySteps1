# This program asks person's name
# and then prints out hello that person's name.
# Author: Eret Haava

name = input('Hello! What is your name? ')
print ('Hello ' + name)

# And a bit different syntax
# name = input('Hello! Enter your name: ')
# print ('Hello ' + name)

print ('Nice to meet you!')

# And a bit different code, replace the print below with the first print
# print('Hello ' + name + '!' '\nNice to meet you!')
# print ('Hello {}!\nNice to meet you!' .format(name))
