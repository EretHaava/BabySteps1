# This program uses a variable to greet
# and asks yout age.
# Author: Eret Haava

name = 'Eret'
print ('Hello ' + name)

# this won't work 
age = 41
# print ('Your age is ' + age)
print ('Your age is ' + str(age))
# the other way is to use format
print ('Hello {} \tYour age is {}' .format(name, age))
